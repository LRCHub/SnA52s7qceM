You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
He's making a list
He's checking it twice
He's find out
who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is coming to town
He sees you
when you're sleeping
And he knows
when you're awake
He knows if you've been
bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Cause Santa Claus is
coming to town
<♪>
He sees you
when you're sleeping
And he knows when you're awake
And he knows if you've
been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming
I'm a big fat man
with a long white beard
He's coming to town
